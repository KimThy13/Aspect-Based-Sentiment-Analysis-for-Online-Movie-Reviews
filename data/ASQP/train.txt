On paper with its high concept and pair of appealing leads Role Play seems like something capable of fun escapist viewing####[["high concept, appealing leads", "Movie", "positive", "capable, fun"]]
but in execution carries a rather nasty mean streak and a rather unpleasant and inconsistent tone####[["execution, tone", "Movie", "negative", "nasty, unpleasant, inconsistent"]]
often times they can feel like cynical products meant to entice couples in for date nights with the promise of action and comedy for both sexes and usually doing both pretty poorly####[["products, action, comedy", "Movie", "negative", "cynical, pretty poorly"]]
With Role Play it does feel like a gender swapped version of 2010s Killers which was not a good movie to begin with####[["movie", "Movie", "negative", "not a good movie"]]
but at least unlike Killers it has a pair of leads who actually have chemistry and are appealing together####[["leads, chemistry", "Acting", "positive", "chemistry, appealing"]]
While Cuoco and Oyelowo do not strive far from the template of slightly bored suburban couple####[["Cuoco, Oyelowo", "Acting", "negative", "not strive far, slightly bored"]]

Unfortunately, while the movie has good leads and a talented comedic actress in Cuoco####[["leads, Cuoco", "Acting", "positive", "good, talented"]]
Role Play is considerably less comedic than the casting and marketing would suggest####[["comedic", "Humor", "negative", "less comedic"]]
to the point you have to wonder if the filmmakers knew what kind of movie they were making####[["filmmakers", "Movie", "negative", "wonder"]]
The movie makes a fatal blow from which it never recovers by having a tedious mid-section where Cuoco and Oyelowo are separated for an extended length of time####[["mid-section, tedious", "Movie", "negative", "fatal blow, tedious"]]
and even when they reunite together at the climax there is an air of nastiness on display that just makes the film feel depressing####[["climax, nastiness", "Movie", "negative", "depressing"]]
Role Play is practically gift-wrapped a rich comedic premise with a pair of leads more than capable of pulling it off####[["comedic premise, leads", "Movie", "positive", "gift-wrapped, capable"]]
and instead of playing as a romantic action comedy it was sold as, it is instead a dour slog touching on darker thematic levels it has no business tackling####[["romantic action comedy, dour slog", "Movie", "negative", "dour, no business"]]
Just skip this one and rent Grosse Point Blank or The Whole Nine Yards####[["NULL", "Movie", "negative", "skip"]]
It is nice to see the likable 39-year-old Kaley Cuoco from The Big Bang Theory in a movie####[["Kaley Cuoco", "Acting", "positive", "nice, likable"]]
The first half of the 100-minute movie is more of a classic rom-com and is entertaining####[["first half, 100-minute movie", "Movie", "positive", "classic rom-com, entertaining"]]
Especially the scene with the Bill Nighy####[["Bill Nighy", "Acting", "positive", "especially"]]
The rest of the movie becomes somehow unnecessarily serious####[["rest of the movie", "Movie", "negative", "unnecessarily serious"]]
It tries to become an action movie####[["action movie", "Movie", "negative", "tries to become"]]
and for an action drama, the script is unfortunately too weak####[["script", "Story", "negative", "too weak"]]
So overall it is safe to skip####[["overall", "Movie", "negative", "safe to skip"]]
For more entertainment value with a similar plot better watch: Date Night 2010 with Steve Carell Tina Fey####[["plot", "Story", "positive", "more entertainment, better watch"]]
