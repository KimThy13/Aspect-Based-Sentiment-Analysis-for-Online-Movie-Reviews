review"Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Think Jason Statham and you come up with vengeance, action, explosions and hand to hand combat with some meaningful one liners""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It is all there in this movie and fans of Statham should be immensely pleased""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The plot is about a retired member of a classified group"" beekeepers"" Adam Clay Jason Statham who is extremely angry because an elderly lady who looks after him has committed suicide after getting scammed of all her money through phishing""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: As per him stealing from elders is worse than stealing from kids""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: He then starts his revenge mission by destroying all those responsible for this and does not stop till he has eliminated them all before walking off into the sunset""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The movie will remind one of the ""Equaliser"", ""John Wick"" and ""Taken"" franchise""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Director David Ayer has made an action thriller which allows Statham to do what he does best, that is extreme aggressiveness coupled with anger, intimidation all with his trademark deadpan expression""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Watch him as he walks in with two fuel cans and tells the receptionist to have building evacuated since he is going to burn it down""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: He also says that when the law fails to deliver justice, he is there to do the needful""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It is Statham all the way as he unleashes his anger and creates mayhem as only he can""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: At some points he bashes up a dozen guys of a SWAT team which seems far fetched""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: At a few other places the action appears beyond the realm of credibility but what the hell it is finally all there for entertainment.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: So these days the protagonist seems to be someone who has no personality, no character development but just goes around being mad""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Actually, none of the characters had any development, except maybe the female FBI agent""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Other than that, it is useless and a waste of hours of my life""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: If you have seen one ""get even"" movie, you have seen this one""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: However maybe not so badly done""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I could care less about any of the characters, the plot was obvious, the build up to the final scene was almost laughable, but I sat through it""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Maybe that was the goal""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Put something on TV a bored person could watch for a couple hours.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Jason Statham sleepwalks through this ""One man against the World"" clunker""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: He has always lacked expression while kicking butt, but he is especially wooden here""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The acting is generally poor from the entire cast""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: So disappointed Phylicia Rashad Jeromy Irons love them both participated""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The dumb script did not help""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Action sequences are well-shot""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Verdict: Preposterous, horrible script and emotionless violence""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Few redeeming features""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Statham should demand better scripts than this""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Everyone attached should ""Bee"" ashamed.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: You either fade into obscurity with dignity or live long enough to shill schlock for the streaming giants""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: And let us not forget that David Ayer has already done this once with Netflix's Bright...""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But The Beekeeper is far from a bad movie; Even when it almost is, Ayer manages to keep it punchy, po-faced, pretty, silly, and simple""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The action is fine but not earth-shattering, it is more the John Wick meets Payback plot that works""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The film addresses Statham's awful transatlantic accent, it has got some interesting motivations, some good dialogue, and solid casting""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Sure it is cheesy and makes no sense, but it is earnest and has a cute villainous organization for our anti-hero to thwart""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Even major actors have terrible movies the pickthis is itHow could anyone rate this higher than 3 or 4 is crazyTerrible totally unbelievable plot""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Bad acting and a poor script""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Bruce Willis had Hudson Hawk and a few others""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This is StrathamsIt was hard to watch it all the way through but just because of Straham and hung in there""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It never got better,Plus in order to get the bad guys he kills a lot of good guys that makes sense""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Might be the worst movie I have seen for a long time""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I am glad I watched it with a close friend of mine and we laughed a lot""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It is a comedy movie, you will laugh a lot""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The acting and the lines are complete nonsense""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There is no sense in anything""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The police officer whose mother was killed almost shed tears of joy...""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There is a terminator main guy whom is attacked by army, but they all attack him one by one""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The speech which is used is terrible, you sometimes wonder what is the point of this words""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I think this director has definitely not watched the movie, I will take note of the name, if I come across it again, I know I should definitely not to watch it.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I do not know where to even start.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Someone said it best, This is written like a 15 year-old wrote it for a weekend project and failed the assignment.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The most tragic thing is that all these good actors and actresses got involved without knowing how bad the director and script were here.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I am still trying to come up with more criticisms of the movie, but you simply do not have the time.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Nothing is believable.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The characters like Verona are horribly developed.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Jason Statham does his Jason Statham bad-a self, but that is not enough to save this sinking ship.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But, maybe it could become a future cult classic or a drinking movie where you take a shot for every one-liner that Jason says.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The Beekeeper is a slick action film predominantly showcasing Jason Stathams amazing fighting skills.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It has a pedestrian plot that boils down everything to ""good versus bad"" with good being morally right and family, and bad being sex, drugs, and money.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I was disappointed because this is a perfect role for Statham.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: He could have imbued some gravitas to the character.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But, instead, he was left with broken from his past career as an Assassin ?.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: We are not told exactly what he was, but it appears he was trained to be a One Man Amry.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: And what sparks his action is that a person who is nice to him post service had something bad happen to him.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There is no character development or purpose for much of the film.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Oh, and then the department code name for his service was Beekeeper.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: So in retirement, he keeps bees and sells honey.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: And then his entire philosophy is based upon bees and hive mentality.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Every point that can be made about beekeeping to highlight why he is acting as he does is made.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Ad nauseam.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: To the point that it became a joke to me.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: If it was the name of his program and he was a Beekeeper, and thus the only thing to call him was ""Beekeeper."" But, superimposing this philosophy onto the film turns this to ""I am A Librarian!"" but without any of the fun that Rachel Weisz brought to the line.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: First the good.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: If you are looking for action, this movie has plenty.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Sadly, that is all it really has going for it, and normally I would say that is enough.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There are plenty of fun action movies that you have to throw reality out the window in order for the story to work.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This movie takes it to an absolutely absurd level.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There is so many negatives and breaks from reality that detract from this movie.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It cannot decide if it wants to be a serious action flick, or something out of the Marvel Universe.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The villains costuming is something out of a bad acid trip, but thankfully most of them only have a few minutes of screen time.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The villain at the end is a Hodge podge of bad guy characteristics it is unintentionally funny.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: From the nearly incoherent Australian accent to the loud yellow costume and horrible hair dye, even if you made it through the first 90 of the movie thinking ""This is not THAT bad"", once you get to this guy, there is no way to defend it any longer.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Then there is the ridiculous depictions of the hierarchy of the Alphabet agencies.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The CIA is involved, the FBI is cowed by a band of mercenaries, and the Secret Service evidently will allow anyone carrying weapons to hang out with the president for ""protection"".""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: On second thought, to call this movie absurd is actually a complement.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This movie strides for absurdity and falls woefully short of even that goal! This is the type of movie dreamed up by a 12 year old boy, hopped up on Monster Energy drinks and a collection of bad comic books.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This movie is that bad.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: If you made it this far, you are probably wondering why I gave it 5 stars.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: And it is a valid question.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Honestly, 5 stars is probably 3 stars too many, but I gave it credit for the first half, where the action was good and the story had not completely jumped the rails yet.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Also, I liked the idea of a super clandestine group of special forces operators who operated far outside of the normal chain of command.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: That type of absurdity I can suspend my disbelief for 90 minutes or so to simply enjoy a fun action movie.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I gave an inch and the movie wanted to take 10,000 miles! Bottom line, if you want to watch it, feel free.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I have definitely suffered through worse movies.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But if you choose to skip it, trust me, you are not missing anything.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I watched about 20 minutes and bailed""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But the script and the acting is just so incredibly stoopid""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But the script and the acting is just so incredibly stoopid""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: that the action was not enough to carry it""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This is a direct to video, bottom of the thrift store bargain bin production""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Better off watching old WWF videos on YouTube for higher quality of script writing and acting to go with the wrasslin action, brother! Ooh yeah!""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I would like to conclude my negative review now""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Hollywood ran out of new ideas years ago""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Now there is a show worth watching, again""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Honestly when I saw the advertisement up i did not think it was going to be that good""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I enjoyed the story""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: loved the fight scenes""Extract aspect, sentiment, and

term: It just does not have any of that stuff""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It is not a bad John Wick ripoff""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The murder is creative and

Same storyline different characters""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The story is very light""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: acting is somewhat ok""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The amount of fights and actions are not good enough to even be considered a normal action movie due to its basicness""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: You can easily tell what the is going to happen next and what the ending is going to be""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The location and camera work is good""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Overall this movie could have been a lot better by having a better bolder story""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This movie is by far the absolute worst thing i have ever laid my eyes upon""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Watching this movie made me reconsider every 1/10 review i have given""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I am shocked that this movie even exists""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The best acting in this movie was terrible""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: the best plot point was

aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Overall: Terrible, Abysmal, Trash, Horrible, Offensive, Dreadful, Awful, Appalling, Horrific, Horrifying, Distressing, Atrocious, Abhorrent, Foul""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It is insulting to 12 year-olds to say this is like something written by a 12 year-old""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It strains credulity so often you just end up sitting there bored and clock-watching""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: However, I am sure plenty of 12 year-old boys will enjoy the sadistic brutality in the film""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: such as chopping people in half with lifts, and other gruesome fantasy sadism""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: If ALL you want to see in movies is fight scenes and blood-letting then this is the film for you""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: If, however, you enjoy a plot, characters or just a semblance of reality - avoid this at all costs""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and I can only assume he does not really enjoy acting, only the pay-check""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: because there is no other motive for this film other than profit""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: To be clear, I enjoy a Jason Statham over-the-top, anime inspired, one-man-army revenge thriller as much as anyone""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: He has taken imaginative and even inspired takes on the heavy, the tough, the man with no name 'High Plains Drifter' type""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Unfortunately, this movie does not bring more than neon and meme writing level dialogue and story""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The paranoia and MAGA baiting is beneath Mr. Statham's talents""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: His pitch unfortunately did not include any martial arts beyond hawking kitchen gadgets""Extract aspect,

it""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The Beekeeper got off to such a promising start""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: For the first 15 minutes I was hooked""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and actually found myself eagerly anticipating the rest of the film""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Then, like a house of cards, it all came tumbling down""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Poor scene after poor scene followed""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Terrible plot choices and overambitious story-lines developed""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and what should have been a very simple and fun movie became an over the top bore""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Other than Jason Statham, absolutely no one was cast well in this film""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Not one single actor suited the role they were playing""Extract aspect, sentiment, and

acquaintance""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: despite the fact they were right next to each other as the photographer snapped away it was not until after the photo shoot ended that they suddenly recognize each other""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: sometimes a movie can be so bad that it keeps you watching this was one of them""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: the main character camille was easy on the eyes so that certainly helped dull the endless painful scenes""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: i would suggest avoiding this one""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: i am a duespaying advocate of the north american bigfoot center and believe that sasquatch is a real living creature""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: groups like the nabc bfro the olympic project and various scientific researchers like dr john bindernagel dr jeff meldrum and the late dr grover krantz have gathered enough evidence to convince me that very large apes are alive and well in the vast reaches of our forests""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and the cultural histories of many native american and first nations peoples include stories and beliefs about nonhuman people of the wild""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: many of these descriptions bear a striking resemblance to the hairy manlike creatures reported today""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: i have always found that to be most convincing""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: but as with many other subjects that are on the outlying borders of what is generally accepted by mainstream science and society in general there will always be certain kinds of people who infuse such subjects with what is known as the woo woo factor""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: woo woo refers to paranormal or fringe religious beliefs and other forms of new age philosophy""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: this is the second release of the flash of beauty film series""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: this edition titled paranormal bigfoot includes many of the same witnesses as we saw in the first film only now we are presented with tales of people who claim to have had psychic interactions with sasquatch that a sasquatch can cloak in order to become invisible can disappear by moving through portals or dimensional shifts can shapeshift into other animals and the suggestion that they ride around in glowing orbs of light or ufos""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: i will go ahead and say that while i will always respect the beliefs practices and choices of others as to what they want to believe i am definitely one of those persons who prefers to stick with hard science and tangible evidence so far as this subject is concerned""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: so yes i was a bit put off with the heavy emphasis of the film along these kinds of woo woo lines""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: i own a copy of the first a flash of beauty release titled bigfoot revealed""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: that film was much more grounded in science and consisted mainly of interviews with witnesses who recounted their bigfoot encounters along with a few photos videos and physical evidence such as hairs and track impressions""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: pretty straightforward wellgrounded stuff and typical of other good sasquatch documentaries""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: i gave bigfoot revealed a much higher rating on here""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: i want to include here that i do not completely dismiss claims of the paranormal""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and if real evidence comes forward that can definitively show that these creatures can do any of the things that the witnesses claim in this film i will be as excited as anyone else""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: but right now i tend to prefer sasquatch evidence that can be measured in a laboratory or examined scientifically""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: if you enjoy bigfoot documentaries but are skeptical of extraordinary claims that are firmly rooted in the realm of the supernatural then you may feel that you wasted your time watching this film""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: be prepared for a whole lot of new age woo woo throughout""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The movie tries many things..... Is it about family coming together, is it about superstition and its effect or is it just comedy.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The problem is with the pace of the movie.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: At times it is fast then slow then again it picks up.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The star cast is great and carry the movie effortlessly.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The opera scene is really funny and differently done.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But sometimes it is funny..... Sometimes it is drama...... Sometimes it is social satire.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: When I saw the trailer, I knew it will be very difficult for the writer to give a logical conclusion and I was right.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The hero though anti-superstitious takes advantage of the same to prove his point.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But what he was trying to prove I do not know.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: So overall nice try.....""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I came to know that the film was released only because director called the father of a person who was reviewing the money, there was no promotion at all, there were only 100 people in the theatre, on the fourth day of the films release.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There was no expectation and the same was the case with a 30-40 minutes in the first half of the film, and then it felt a little better, by the time the interval.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Then the second half had no words, the making that looked like a Hollywood movie, the scenes, the film that was watched without any expectations and at the end of the day i got to see people standing up and clapping their hands, in a word it was a great film.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: A great scenery and good choice of the house. Back to nature of course nothing can go wrong with this choice.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Most Horror movie will be in a remote places far from civilization. It is the best places to keep secrets and to keep all your activities under the rather well at least for such a time.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: You know there are sayings.. You can lie to some people at one time but cannot lie to all of the people all the time.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: For once this movie portrays a strong will women. Normally horror movies will bank in on a weak and fragile women or lady. Which tend to scream every three minutes or so but not in this number.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It is totally different quote un quote. One more thing this film does not emphasize on jump scare tactics like another anomaly in any given horror movies.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Another plus point from my point of view.

all the modern cgi it couldve been so much better""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: it loses context""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: an opportunity was lost""Extract

aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I love the opening of this film""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and it was going to a really good place""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But quickly it became almost formula driven""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: with just absurd action scene after unbelievable action scene""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: You do not get the sense that the characters have built any trust""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: or communication that would help them both move forward""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Ultimately, after the first 15 minutes of the film, the action becomes like an algorithm""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It just became so unbelievable""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and you felt no compassion for any of the characters""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and ultimately the film just left you empty""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I really had high hopes, that this would break that genre""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and honestly, the topic was

beekeeper""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Maybe I am just another conspiracy theorist, but I really believe this movie is more real than one could think""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: In fact, it wonders me how it got produced, considering all the Hunter Biden notebook thing""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: And this abusive 600 hundreds characters iss annoying""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: ClichÃ©d story, predictable screenplay""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and boring characters""Extract aspect, sentiment, and

well and overall its a decent horror film""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The idea of a pool that both gives and takes was interesting""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and the promos made me think this would be worth watching""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I was wrong, it is not the boring slog of something like Baghead""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: but it is not something that you will think about for long after you have left the cinema""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: In fact, I completely forgot I would watched it until I read a review of another film and they mentioned it""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I agree with a number of the lower marking reviews when they go through the limitations of the setup""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: but still good writers can write around this and still pull you in with scares, jumps, well written characters or dialog""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: All things missing from this film""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It appears that many modern directors, particularly those in the mainstream space, are struggling to capture the true essence of horror""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The neat art of terrifying people seems to be fading away as movies become less and less frightening""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Take ""Night Swim"" as an example. It has an intriguing concept, solid technical aspects as well as an able ensemble, yet it fails to leave a lasting impact""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This can be attributed solely to the amateurish direction, which completely missed the mark on how to approach the core idea and leave the audience gasping for breath in fear""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: What is even more surprising is that James Wan, a prominent figure in the horror community, is one of the producers, along with Jason Blum, another well-known name among the fans""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This movie is 99 fillers 1 movie. Most of the time you just see random everyday things. Like the kids going to school, neighbors having small talk, laughing""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: When things get interesting the scene is cut short like they do not have enough time for horror scenes""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The movie could have been good but spends way too much time in meaningless things""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It felt like a chore watching this movie. It is very difficult to keep watching as there is nothing interesting happening most of the movie""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: What is with all the male characters being beta? It is like they are background characters they do not have an opinion""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Stay away from this movie. It will put you to sleep from boredom""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This film stars Wyatt Russell as ex pro baseball player Ray Waller whose family moves into a new home after he is forced into an early retirement due to illness""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: He and his family believe that they have found the perfect home, until some sinister events start taking place around the in-ground pool""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The film was directed by Bryce McGuire and written by McGuire and Rod Blackhurst""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It is based off of a short film of the same name that they wrote together in 2014""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I think what really made this movie enjoyable for me was the way that it was shot""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Bryce McGuire used many camera angles that made it feel like you were also swimming in the pool which I felt added to the horror of the film""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Additionally, I enjoyed the overall message that the film was sending""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This film was not just about a family that has some issues with a pool, it has an underlying message about the importance of family and the sacrifices you need to make for the ones you love......or at the expense of those you love""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The fact that the main character is a pro baseball player fed nicely into this message as many pro athletes, especially baseball players, often have to make many sacrifices, sometimes at the expense of those that they love""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This film had everything a good summer horror film needs and it deserves more hype than it is getting""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Yes I said summer because I believe this film would have been better received had it been released a little later in the year""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: If you are looking for a fun horror film with just the right amount of scary, I recommend going to see Night Swim""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The reviews make this movie look like a disappointment, however, it is par for the course for a horror movie""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The acting is pretty good""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: the plot is very intriguing""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and the only failure is the effects""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The monster is not consistent, it looks different literally every time we see it""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and the effects are Ghostbusters level, or maybe worse actually. Like, clearly animated""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But otherwise it is a pretty good movie and actually gave me the heebie jeebies once or twice""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The script is intriguing enough""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: with one scene that is a little cringey feat""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: but what else can we expect from a horror movie?""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Worth the watch""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: No. This movie was your average telling of another horror story trying to grab horror fans in a different way by using the homes swimming pool as the movies monster""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Original idea but at the same time predictable and just as average as most attempts at horror movies these days""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Most fail to hit the mark and this one I am sorry to say struck out pun intended""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: If you are someone who just loves a scare without the repercussions of feeling the guilt of know you consciencely chose to spend an hour and a half of your life you will never get back d it does t bother you then by all means enjoy mediocrity as most people these days who would not know a true horror film if it bit them in the rear end""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Enjoy!""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: To be honest, I did not know about this movie and decided to watch this movie after I read about it on twitter/ X""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The story was simple with more focus on drama than horror""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: the screenplay was uneven as the it should have been more tight with more thrills""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: the direction was average and the performances were also average""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The main problem movie faced was the pacing issue, it is slow for a psychological horror drama genre""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Also, the thrills and suspense part were weak points of the movie as it should be strong for this genre""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Overall, it was a decent movie which tries to show something but does not offer that much""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I have to say after seeing the trailer I could tell it was going to be a iffy experience movie wise""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: However, to my surprise I found myself glued to the screen giving it my undivided attention and was undoubtedly entertained""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The acting specifically that of the father was lackluster""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Not sure who else was auditioning for this role but maybe they deserved a second go at it""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Story wise I have to say I was satisfied with the plot beginning to end""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This was the first movie I had gone to see outside of ironclaw this year""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Have to say it was a great pallet cleanser and one I would watch again""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The story and the cast was so lame and boring.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There are some things I did not understand in the movie and others here explained here very well, I will not write it again.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I only wanted to say that you should let your kiddo do w/e she/he wants dude.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I do not really understand why get a kid to play in a movie, or sing at the theatre when it is obviously that she got 0 talent in the artistic area, she cannot sing like her mother, she cannot act like her father.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Dude, let the kid play and get her some diction courses because in the movie I did not understand much because she cannot speak and she has problems with her voice.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Really annoying.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The good: Some of the actors are great, mainly the three main ladies, the work colleagues and the kids.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The bad: The main character was played in a non-sympathetic way.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I think we are supposed to like this guy by the end, but because of bad acting or bad directing or bad casting, this did not work.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There are very few genuinely funny moments, because of the main problem of this film - the script!""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Alternating between cringe-inducing jokes, casual and overt misogyny, and clichÃ©s so stale they mustve dug them up from a time capsule planted in 1991, it honestly looks like the script was badly translated form a rejected American tv-movie or generated by AI.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Last but not least, the product placement is very obvious and obnoxious.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It is so bad, they are just one step away from just facing the camera and reciting ad copy directly to the viewer.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I watched this and got totally engrossed in it.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Who does not miss the 1980 s and does not just love a hot sexy femme fatale vampire?""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This film reminded me of a time 2000 s when life was simpler, innocent, and fun.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It made me feel like a teen again and very nostalgic.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Which hot blooded teenage boy does not fantasize about being caught up in a love triangle with a succubus and a high school sweet heart?""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The lead trio are very good actors: the vampire, the teen and the high school crush.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The story was good, pacing was good and was a fun watch with good supportive cast.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I have saved this movie, and will likely watch it again.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I will now be binge watching as many vampire flicks as I can for the rest of May!""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The special effects budget was about 2.50, most of which was spent on red corn syrup and eyeliner to draw squiggly lines on Victorias face.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Victorias costumes came from the SHEIN Halloween sale.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Cameron was as likeable as Covid on your birthday and at least then you still get presents.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Why Diane was vaguely interested in Cameron was the greatest mystery as she was a beautiful woman and he looked like a McDonalds employee.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: For the entire film the ice cream shop did not have a single customer to save on the cost of extras.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: All of this terribleness was why I could not stop watching this movie until the end.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: At one point it seemed like it was going to turn into a porno but alas no as this did seem to be the directors true calling.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: All the actors gave it their best shots with what little they had to work with.""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Gold stars to you all and to the director and writer I will leave you with the comment my sisters teacher gave her in a school report ""Jessica always likes to contribute in class however the relevance of her contributions are not always apparent"".""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This movie was the best""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It was exciting until the very end""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Kept me on the edge of my seat""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Kept thinking I figured it out, was endlessly wrong""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Sooooo good""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Completely satisfying as a whole the ending""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The characters were so good""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The acting was spectacular""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It was a heart racing, full of heartfelt emotions revenge you get mad excited for the characters""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: My mom I just finished this movie we both were so involved cheering, crying, yelling""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The characters story acting emotion was felt from the first scene until the last picture""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Soooo goood""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: We recommend""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: On so many levels this movie was horrible""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I am guessing it was brought to the screen merely as a tax write off""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Unless you are beyond desperate for something to watch, watch anything else""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Watching paint dry comes to mind""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: On so many levels this movie was horrible/bad""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I am guessing it was brought to the screen merely as a tax write off""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Unless you are beyond desperate for something to watch, watch anything else""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Watching paint dry comes to mind""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: On so many levels this movie was horrible""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I am guessing it was brought to the screen merely as a tax write off""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Unless you are beyond desperate for something to watch, watch anything else""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Watching paint dry comes to mind""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Listen..im being generous, the production company films listed here are all you needed to know""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: the no expressions, the terrible plot with cut scenes of no explanation""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The cgi and acting is subpar to the point where id rather watch a middle school production""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The cgi and acting is subpar to the point where id rather watch a middle school production""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: No explanation of the bad guys, doesnt even follow traditional action movie protocol""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: john voight mustve been bored because this film was PAINFUL""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Only finished on the smallest chance the ending is redeemable, but ofc it was a letdown""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The amount of gun shooting errors""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: the chief actress doesnt even act convincing for their role""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Not worth re watching""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: OK, so it starts of with Voight wearing the most ridiculous costume trying to sneak up on his protege in a diner followed by some cringe worthy dialogue""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: We then move onto a fight scene where it seemed all the out takes were left in""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: if you cannot even attempt to do it right try something else that does not look like 2 or more robots moving in pre-planned moves""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There are so many ways to bring alive an actors abilities but sadly, none were used in this mashup of drivel""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I could not bear to watch more than 15 minutes thinking 'maybe it will improve'""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I wasted 14 of those minutes before giving up with the thought 'who pays people to make such rubbish'""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Very enjoyable and entertaining""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Charlie Webber is quite fitting for this role""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and John Voight is very cool as usual""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This is the type of movie that does not thrive on innovation but on a very interesting variation of certain plots""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Imaging and acting is quite nice, especially the actress that plays Sophia""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Imaging and acting is quite nice, especially the actress that plays Sophia""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The fighting scenes are nicely choreographed, and attempt a more realistic type fighting""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: although it is clear that in actual reality things would go quite differently""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The reason we watch entertaining action movies such as this is however to break away from reality a little bit, so that is a good thing""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: All in all, I enjoyed this film quite a lot""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This is a rom-com about an assassin who wanted a shot at a normal life""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Not something new, it has been done a few times""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: And to be honest, in terms of storyline, the earlier movies with the same theme were better than this""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: And also Kaley Cuoco as a hit woman does not make a lot of sense""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I love her in lots of movies, but as an assassin? That just makes zero sense""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Not just that she does not have the posture as a killer, she also does not possess the attitude as one""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But aside of those shortcomings, this movie is still watchable""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The comedy was pretty funny, it can give you some chuckles""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: So you should give it a try, if you have some time to kill""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It can get rid of your boredom""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The trailer drew me in and, unlike some reviews, I did not feel that it misrepresented the film""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Oyelowo really makes this film work, he seems to really pull out the humor of his part with perfect expressions and actions""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Him and Connie Nielsen were the standout stars for me and I should mention the kids did a great job, as well, considering I normally do not like inexperienced child actors in a film- they did not come off as an experienced despite their limited dialogue""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: A lot of people mention Kaley Cuaco being such a great actress but I personally never heard of her before and the fact that she is a dead ringer for Leah Remini is kind of distracting""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I mean the Brooklyn housewife who speaks and acts just barely above trailer living just did not seem like the best lead for this role""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Having said that, I admit Kaley did a great job it just felt more like a comedian trying to act serious instead of a serious actress pulling off a good comedy role like stars such as Sandra Bullock or Vivica A Fox have been known for""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I have not seen Connie Nelson in that much although I just recently watched her in Bob Odenkirks Nobody - good film - and I do remember her in Gladiator""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But I have not realized until now she has a resemblance to Kim Basinger, especially in her later years""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This film is surprising and while some people may consider it a rip off of this film or that film, I did not feel that way at all""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It actually had a unique vibe and it moved quickly wrapping up well""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Of course, it is a dramatic action comedy so we already know it is not realistic - we do not need to even broach that subject""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: My personal opinion about this having a lot of low star reviews is that people are not ready for women to be in that kind of a role even though we had Emma Peal way back in the 60s, Cleopatra Jones in the 80s and many more bad arse women since""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I mean this is not a new thing guys, come on and get up to speed""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I found this film very entertaining and I was a little sad when it ended even though I liked the ending""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I think women will definitely like it more than guys for the mere fact that they may feel emasculated by the role of the husband and have a lot of criticism for it. But for women, he rolled with the punches and we all knew that they loved each other, and that is what you do for love""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: A semi-interesting and uninteresting movie that could have been so much more without children, with a more serious husband and more threatening villains""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Everything is wasted besides Emma and Carolines characters who are funny, interesting and quirky to some degree""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: That is not a serious movie, it gets the ratings that it deserves and is watchable with 12 kids""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: All that said, the ending leaves alot to be desired""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Screenplay/storyline/plots: 5.5 Development: 7 Realism: 5.5 Entertainment: 4.5 Acting: 6.5 Filming/photography/cinematography: 7.5 VFX: 7.5 Music/score/sound: 6.5 Depth: 4.5 Logic: 2.5 Flow: 5 Action/comedy/romance: 4.5 Ending: 3""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Ugh this is a bad movie""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The lead actress is awful and cannot act""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There is zero chemistry between the couple""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The plot is boring""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The dialog ludicrous""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The kids are not cute sorry kids""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The villains are cartoonish""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Zero laughs. Zero suspense""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The action is ridiculous""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: And the ending....what?""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: One star is Bill Nighy how did he get roped into that?""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and the other is the cute puppy""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Otherwise, zero stars""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It is that bad""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: My husband and I watched it bc the trailer looked good and we were in the mood for a comedy""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: I do not think I even grinned once""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: We kept hoping it would get good. It did not""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Do not waste your time""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There is no mystery to be solved throughout the movie""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: that is why it is not exciting to watch""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Just in the beginning of the show we are already shown that the woman has a double life and is a serial killer""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: The movie makes you know about every detail that shouldve been revealed later in the show""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It gets boring since it is so predictable""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There is most probably no emotional impact this movies going to give you""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: There is not even a focus on romance""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It neither feels romantic, nor thrilling""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It is hot spicy, it is not funny""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: It feels more like the prototype of a movie than the movie itself""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: One of the worst produced movies I have seen""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: This is not a movie that will rank among the top movies of the year""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: but still is fun entertainment if one does not dig too deeply""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Emma has a secret job and is married to Dave""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Dave thinks she is a troubleshooter for a company, which is why she travels so much""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: They are married, with a boy from his former marriage, and a girl from theirs, and seem a happy family""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: She forgets her anniversary, and to make it up decides to role play""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: They will meet as strangers at a hotel bar and then have a romantic evening""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: He is delayed in traffic, and before he gets there, a man moves in on her. He is a hit man and things go badly, and suddenly the spotlight is on her""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: But Dave knows nothing other than a man was killed at the same hotel they stayed at""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: She has to take care of some loose ends, and this is perhaps the strongest part of the movie""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: How will she extract herself, when those directing her want her to continue as an assassin?""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: For those digging deeply into the plot points and execution, they will be underwhelmed""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: For those who simply want some breezy entertainment, they should be satisfied""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: George

halfway through a screenplay then forgot everything he previously wrote but just kept writing instead of scrapping it and restarting""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: Proceed with caution""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion term: and now the target is the phishing scammer, a group of people that we all agree are truly despicable""Extract aspect, sentiment, and opinion
